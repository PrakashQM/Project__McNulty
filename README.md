# Project McNulty :

Project goal is to apply supervised learning to a classification problems.  

    - Algorithms are considered
       
        + Logistic Regression
        + K nearest neighbour
        + Support Vector Machine
        + Kernel SVM
        + Decision Tress
        + Ensemble methods  
          - averaging methods : Bagging methods, random Forest
          - Boosting methods : AdaBoost, Gradient Tree Boosting
     
Besides applying supervised Machine learning algorithms for classification problem, project goal is also to get experience with SQL, dynamic data visualization and python web develpment tools Flask. Project also requires setting up a PostgreSQL server on AWS. Create databases and write schemas.
